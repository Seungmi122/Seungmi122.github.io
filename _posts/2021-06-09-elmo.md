# Contextual Representation 

**Static representation** such as *Word2Vec, Glove* considers a word as a single vector with a single fixed meaning.

However, in many cases, a word has different meanings depending on its syntax, semantics and context, so  that we are needed to learn its **dynamic** representation. 

--> **Contextual representation** such as **ELMo, BERT, GPT** thinks that a single word can have *multiple vectors*

# ELMo: Embeddings from Language Models

use vectors from bi-directional LSTM trained with language models on a large text corpus

How it works?

*Language Modeling* 



# Bidirectional language models
